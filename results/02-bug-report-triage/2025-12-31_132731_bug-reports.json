Your task is to analyze incoming bug reports and classify them with structured attributes for automated ticketing system ingestion.\n\nFor each bug report, you must classify:\n\n**SEVERITY** (choose one):\n- **critical**: Financial/legal risk, data loss, security breach, complete service outage\n- **high**: Core functionality broken, users locked out, no workaround available\n- **medium**: Degraded performance or partial functionality, workarounds exist\n- **low**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconveniences, enhancement requests\n\n**COMPONENT** (choose one):\nui, backend, database, auth, payments, api, mobile, infrastructure\n\n**TYPE** (choose one):\n- **bug**: Actual defect in existing functionality\n- **feature_request**: Request for new functionality or enhancement\n- **question**: User inquiry or clarification needed\n- **documentation**: Documentation issue\n\n**ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY** (choose one):\ncode_defect, configuration, data_issue, third_party, user_error, unknown\n\n**REPRODUCIBILITY** (choose one):\nalways, sometimes, rare, cannot_reproduce, unknown\n\n**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES**:\n1. Distinguish bugs from feature requests - if functionality never existed, it's likely a feature request\n2. Consider user error as a possibility when symptoms suggest misunderstanding\n3. Assess severity by business impact, not user emotion\n4. For vague reports, mark reproducibility as \"unknown\" and note missing information\n5. Identify potential duplicates by matching symptoms, not just keywords\n6. Multi-component issues should be assigned to the primary affected component\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**:\nReturn valid JSON matching this exact schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bug_id\": \"BUG-XXX\",\n  \"classification\": {\n    \"severity\": \"critical|high|medium|low\",\n    \"severity_rationale\": \"Brief explanation of severity assessment\",\n    \"component\": \"ui|backend|database|auth|payments|api|mobile|infrastructure\",\n    \"type\": \"bug|feature_request|question|documentation\",\n    \"root_cause_category\": \"code_defect|configuration|data_issue|third_party|user_error|unknown\",\n    \"reproducibility\": \"always|sometimes|rare|cannot_reproduce|unknown\"\n  },\n  \"potential_duplicates\": [\n    {\n      \"bug_id\": \"BUG-YYY\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high|medium|low\",\n      \"rationale\": \"Why this might be a duplicate\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"missing_information\": [\"List of information that would help triage\"],\n  \"suggested_assignee_team\": \"Team name based on component\"\n}\n```\n\n**INPUT DATA**:\nYou will receive bug reports with: bug_id, title, description, reporter, reported_date\n\nAnalyze each report and provide the classification in the exact JSON format specified above.",
    "judge_prompt": "You are evaluating the quality of bug report triage classifications produced by an LLM against human-labeled ground truth.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\nCompare the LLM output against the ground truth classification and score it based on accuracy, format compliance, and reasoning quality.\n\n**EVALUATION CRITERIA**:\n\n## 1. CRITICAL FIELD ACCURACY (40 points)\nThese fields must match exactly or have strong justification for deviation:\n\n- **severity** (10 points): Exact match required. Severity misclassification has serious business consequences.\n  - Critical/High confusion: -5 points (moderate impact)\n  - Medium/Low confusion: -3 points (minor impact)\n  - Critical/Low or High/Low confusion: -10 points (severe misclassification)\n  \n- **component** (10 points): Exact match required. Wrong component = wrong team assignment.\n  - Incorrect component: -10 points\n  - Acceptable if multi-component issue and LLM chose a reasonable primary: -3 points\n\n- **type** (10 points): Exact match required. Bug vs feature request distinction is critical.\n  - Incorrect type: -10 points\n  - Bug/feature_request confusion: -8 points (most critical distinction)\n\n- **root_cause_category** (5 points): Some flexibility allowed as this is often uncertain.\n  - Incorrect when ground truth is definitive (not \"unknown\"): -5 points\n  - Marked as \"unknown\" when ground truth has specific category: -2 points\n\n- **reproducibility** (5 points): Should match ground truth assessment.\n  - Incorrect reproducibility: -5 points\n  - Marked as \"unknown\" when insufficient info in report: -0 points (acceptable)\n\n## 2. FORMAT COMPLIANCE (20 points)\n\n- **Valid JSON structure** (5 points): Must be parseable JSON\n  - Invalid JSON: -5 points\n  \n- **Schema adherence** (10 points): All required fields present with correct types\n  - Missing required field: -3 points per field\n  - Incorrect field type: -2 points per field\n  \n- **Enum value compliance** (5 points): All categorical fields use exact allowed values\n  - Invalid enum value: -2 points per violation\n\n## 3. DUPLICATE DETECTION (15 points)\n\n- **Precision** (7 points): Are identified duplicates actually duplicates?\n  - False positive duplicate: -3 points per false positive\n  \n- **Recall** (8 points): Are known duplicates detected?\n  - Missed duplicate from ground truth: -4 points per miss\n  - Partial credit if identified with \"low\" confidence: -2 points\n\n## 4. REASONING QUALITY (15 points)\n\n- **severity_rationale** (8 points): Should explain business impact clearly\n  - Missing or vague rationale: -4 points\n  - Rationale contradicts severity choice: -8 points\n  - Rationale focuses on user emotion rather than impact: -3 points\n  \n- **duplicate rationale** (4 points): Should explain symptom similarity\n  - Missing rationale for duplicates: -2 points per duplicate\n  \n- **missing_information** (3 points): Should identify reasonable diagnostic gaps\n  - Completely missing when report is vague: -3 points\n  - Unreasonable requests: -1 point\n\n## 5. TEAM ASSIGNMENT (10 points)\n\n- **suggested_assignee_team** (10 points): Should logically map to component\n  - Incorrect team for component: -10 points\n  - Reasonable alternative team name: -3 points\n\n**SCORING CALCULATION**:\n1. Start with 100 points\n2. Apply penalties for each violation\n3. Minimum score: 0\n4. Maximum score: 100\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**:\nProvide your evaluation as JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bug_id\": \"BUG-XXX\",\n  \"total_score\": 85,\n  \"category_scores\": {\n    \"critical_field_accuracy\": 35,\n    \"format_compliance\": 20,\n    \"duplicate_detection\": 12,\n    \"reasoning_quality\": 13,\n    \"team_assignment\": 10\n  },\n  \"violations\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"critical_field_accuracy\",\n      \"field\": \"severity\",\n      \"issue\": \"Marked as 'medium' but ground truth is 'high'\",\n      \"penalty\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"strengths\": [\"List positive aspects of the classification\"],\n  \"weaknesses\": [\"List areas for improvement\"],\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"Brief summary of quality\"\n}\n```\n\n**COMPARISON INSTRUCTIONS**:\n1. Load both LLM output and ground truth for the same bug_id\n2. Compare each field systematically\n3. For categorical fields: exact string match required (case-insensitive)\n4. For arrays (potential_duplicates, missing_information): check overlap and reasonableness\n5. For rationale fields: assess logical consistency and relevance\n6. Apply penalties according to the rubric above\n7. Provide constructive feedback in strengths/weaknesses\n\n**SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS**:\n- If report is genuinely ambiguous, accept reasonable alternative classifications with explanation\n- For multi-component issues, accept any reasonable primary component choice\n- \"unknown\" is acceptable for root_cause and reproducibility when report lacks details\n- Duplicate detection: focus on symptom matching, not keyword matching\n- Severity assessment: prioritize business impact over user sentiment",

      "reasoning": "The LLM output demonstrates strong format compliance with valid JSON structure and proper schema adherence. However, there are significant accuracy issues: (1) Critical severity misclassifications on BUG-009 (high vs critical) and BUG-010 (medium vs high), resulting in -10 points; (2) Multiple component mismatches including BUG-003 (ui vs backend), BUG-024 (database vs api), and BUG-025 (ui vs mobile), resulting in -30 points; (3) Type misclassifications on BUG-011 and BUG-012, resulting in -20 points; (4) Root cause category errors on multiple bugs, resulting in -15 points; (5) Reproducibility mismatches on BUG-003 and BUG-010, resulting in -10 points. The duplicate detection shows poor recall with 11 missed duplicates across multiple bugs (BUG-002, BUG-003, BUG-009, BUG-010, BUG-014, BUG-017, BUG-019, BUG-024), resulting in -44 points. One critical issue is BUG-024 using 'infrastructure' as root_cause_category, which is not a valid enum value. The severity rationales are generally clear and focus on business impact appropriately. Team assignments are mostly correct and logical. Overall, the model performs well on format and basic classification but struggles with duplicate detection, component identification in ambiguous cases, and distinguishing between similar severity levels.",

      "reasoning": "CRITICAL FIELD ACCURACY (82/100): The LLM performed well overall but had several notable issues. Component misclassifications for BUG-003 (ui vs backend) and BUG-024 (database vs infrastructure) resulted in -20 points. Severity misclassifications occurred for BUG-007, BUG-009, BUG-010, and BUG-013, where the LLM underestimated severity by one level (high vs critical, or medium vs high), resulting in -20 points total. Type, root_cause_category, and reproducibility fields were generally accurate. FORMAT COMPLIANCE (100/100): All outputs are valid JSON with correct schema adherence and proper enum values. DUPLICATE DETECTION (67/100): The LLM missed several key duplicates: BUG-009/BUG-017 (-4), BUG-010/BUG-024 (-4), and BUG-003/BUG-024 (-4). However, it correctly identified BUG-002/BUG-014 bidirectionally and BUG-003/BUG-019. Total penalty: -12 points. REASONING QUALITY (95/100): Severity rationales were generally strong and focused on business impact. Missing information requests were appropriate and diagnostic. Duplicate rationales were provided where duplicates were identified. Minor deduction for some rationales that could be more specific. TEAM ASSIGNMENT (100/100): All team assignments logically mapped to components, with reasonable team name variations. OVERALL: The model demonstrates strong understanding of bug triage principles with good format compliance and reasoning. Main weaknesses are in component identification for performance/infrastructure issues and conservative severity assessments that underestimate business impact.",
