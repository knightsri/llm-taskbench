Your task is to analyze incoming bug reports and classify them with structured attributes for automated ticketing system ingestion.\n\nFor each bug report, you must classify:\n\n**SEVERITY** (choose one):\n- **critical**: Financial/legal risk, data loss, security breach, complete service outage\n- **high**: Core functionality broken, users locked out, no workaround available\n- **medium**: Degraded performance or partial functionality, workarounds exist\n- **low**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconveniences, enhancement requests\n\n**COMPONENT** (choose one):\nui, backend, database, auth, payments, api, mobile, infrastructure\n\n**TYPE** (choose one):\n- **bug**: Actual defect in existing functionality\n- **feature_request**: Request for new functionality or enhancement\n- **question**: User inquiry or clarification needed\n- **documentation**: Documentation issue\n\n**ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY** (choose one):\ncode_defect, configuration, data_issue, third_party, user_error, unknown\n\n**REPRODUCIBILITY** (choose one):\nalways, sometimes, rare, cannot_reproduce, unknown\n\n**IMPORTANT GUIDELINES**:\n1. Distinguish bugs from feature requests - if functionality never existed, it's likely a feature request\n2. Consider user error as a possibility when symptoms suggest misunderstanding\n3. Assess severity by business impact, not user emotion\n4. For vague reports, mark reproducibility as \"unknown\" and note missing information\n5. Identify potential duplicates by matching symptoms, not just keywords\n6. Multi-component issues should be assigned to the primary affected component\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**:\nReturn valid JSON matching this exact schema:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bug_id\": \"BUG-XXX\",\n  \"classification\": {\n    \"severity\": \"critical|high|medium|low\",\n    \"severity_rationale\": \"Brief explanation of severity assessment\",\n    \"component\": \"ui|backend|database|auth|payments|api|mobile|infrastructure\",\n    \"type\": \"bug|feature_request|question|documentation\",\n    \"root_cause_category\": \"code_defect|configuration|data_issue|third_party|user_error|unknown\",\n    \"reproducibility\": \"always|sometimes|rare|cannot_reproduce|unknown\"\n  },\n  \"potential_duplicates\": [\n    {\n      \"bug_id\": \"BUG-YYY\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high|medium|low\",\n      \"rationale\": \"Why this might be a duplicate\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"missing_information\": [\"List of information that would help triage\"],\n  \"suggested_assignee_team\": \"Team name based on component\"\n}\n```\n\n**INPUT DATA**:\nYou will receive bug reports with: bug_id, title, description, reporter, reported_date\n\nAnalyze each report and provide the classification in the exact JSON format specified above.",
    "judge_prompt": "You are evaluating the quality of bug report triage classifications produced by an LLM against human-labeled ground truth.\n\n**YOUR TASK**:\nCompare the LLM output against the ground truth classification and score it based on accuracy, format compliance, and reasoning quality.\n\n**EVALUATION CRITERIA**:\n\n## 1. CRITICAL FIELD ACCURACY (40 points)\nThese fields must match exactly or have strong justification for deviation:\n\n- **severity** (10 points): Exact match required. Severity misclassification has serious business consequences.\n  - Critical/High confusion: -5 points (moderate impact)\n  - Medium/Low confusion: -3 points (minor impact)\n  - Critical/Low or High/Low confusion: -10 points (severe misclassification)\n  \n- **component** (10 points): Exact match required. Wrong component = wrong team assignment.\n  - Incorrect component: -10 points\n  - Acceptable if multi-component issue and LLM chose a reasonable primary: -3 points\n\n- **type** (10 points): Exact match required. Bug vs feature request distinction is critical.\n  - Incorrect type: -10 points\n  - Bug/feature_request confusion: -8 points (most critical distinction)\n\n- **root_cause_category** (5 points): Some flexibility allowed as this is often uncertain.\n  - Incorrect when ground truth is definitive (not \"unknown\"): -5 points\n  - Marked as \"unknown\" when ground truth has specific category: -2 points\n\n- **reproducibility** (5 points): Should match ground truth assessment.\n  - Incorrect reproducibility: -5 points\n  - Marked as \"unknown\" when insufficient info in report: -0 points (acceptable)\n\n## 2. FORMAT COMPLIANCE (20 points)\n\n- **Valid JSON structure** (5 points): Must be parseable JSON\n  - Invalid JSON: -5 points\n  \n- **Schema adherence** (10 points): All required fields present with correct types\n  - Missing required field: -3 points per field\n  - Incorrect field type: -2 points per field\n  \n- **Enum value compliance** (5 points): All categorical fields use exact allowed values\n  - Invalid enum value: -2 points per violation\n\n## 3. DUPLICATE DETECTION (15 points)\n\n- **Precision** (7 points): Are identified duplicates actually duplicates?\n  - False positive duplicate: -3 points per false positive\n  \n- **Recall** (8 points): Are known duplicates detected?\n  - Missed duplicate from ground truth: -4 points per miss\n  - Partial credit if identified with \"low\" confidence: -2 points\n\n## 4. REASONING QUALITY (15 points)\n\n- **severity_rationale** (8 points): Should explain business impact clearly\n  - Missing or vague rationale: -4 points\n  - Rationale contradicts severity choice: -8 points\n  - Rationale focuses on user emotion rather than impact: -3 points\n  \n- **duplicate rationale** (4 points): Should explain symptom similarity\n  - Missing rationale for duplicates: -2 points per duplicate\n  \n- **missing_information** (3 points): Should identify reasonable diagnostic gaps\n  - Completely missing when report is vague: -3 points\n  - Unreasonable requests: -1 point\n\n## 5. TEAM ASSIGNMENT (10 points)\n\n- **suggested_assignee_team** (10 points): Should logically map to component\n  - Incorrect team for component: -10 points\n  - Reasonable alternative team name: -3 points\n\n**SCORING CALCULATION**:\n1. Start with 100 points\n2. Apply penalties for each violation\n3. Minimum score: 0\n4. Maximum score: 100\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**:\nProvide your evaluation as JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"bug_id\": \"BUG-XXX\",\n  \"total_score\": 85,\n  \"category_scores\": {\n    \"critical_field_accuracy\": 35,\n    \"format_compliance\": 20,\n    \"duplicate_detection\": 12,\n    \"reasoning_quality\": 13,\n    \"team_assignment\": 10\n  },\n  \"violations\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"critical_field_accuracy\",\n      \"field\": \"severity\",\n      \"issue\": \"Marked as 'medium' but ground truth is 'high'\",\n      \"penalty\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"strengths\": [\"List positive aspects of the classification\"],\n  \"weaknesses\": [\"List areas for improvement\"],\n  \"overall_assessment\": \"Brief summary of quality\"\n}\n```\n\n**COMPARISON INSTRUCTIONS**:\n1. Load both LLM output and ground truth for the same bug_id\n2. Compare each field systematically\n3. For categorical fields: exact string match required (case-insensitive)\n4. For arrays (potential_duplicates, missing_information): check overlap and reasonableness\n5. For rationale fields: assess logical consistency and relevance\n6. Apply penalties according to the rubric above\n7. Provide constructive feedback in strengths/weaknesses\n\n**SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS**:\n- If report is genuinely ambiguous, accept reasonable alternative classifications with explanation\n- For multi-component issues, accept any reasonable primary component choice\n- \"unknown\" is acceptable for root_cause and reproducibility when report lacks details\n- Duplicate detection: focus on symptom matching, not keyword matching\n- Severity assessment: prioritize business impact over user sentiment",

      "reasoning": "The LLM output demonstrates strong format compliance with valid JSON structure and proper schema adherence across all 25 bug reports. However, there are significant accuracy issues: (1) Critical Field Accuracy (28/40): Multiple severity misclassifications including BUG-009 (high vs critical), BUG-010 (medium vs high), BUG-013 (medium vs high), and BUG-023 (critical vs high). Component errors in BUG-003 (ui vs backend) and BUG-012 (api vs backend). Type confusion in BUG-011 (documentation vs bug). Root cause mismatches in BUG-004, BUG-009, BUG-010, and BUG-014. Reproducibility errors in BUG-003, BUG-004, and BUG-010. (2) Format Compliance (20/20): Perfect JSON structure and schema adherence. (3) Duplicate Detection (7/15): Completely missed all potential duplicates identified in ground truth (BUG-002/014, BUG-003/019/024, BUG-009/017, BUG-010/024). (4) Reasoning Quality (12/15): Generally good severity rationales but some focus on symptoms rather than business impact. Missing information fields are reasonable. (5) Team Assignment (8/10): Mostly correct but BUG-008 should be Product Team not UI Team. Overall, the model shows good structural compliance but needs improvement in severity assessment consistency, duplicate detection, and component identification for performance-related issues.",

      "reasoning": "The LLM output demonstrates strong overall performance with excellent format compliance and mostly accurate classifications. All 25 bug reports are properly formatted as valid JSON with correct schema adherence and enum values (format_score: 100/100). Critical field accuracy is generally good (88/100) with correct identification of most severity levels, components, types, and root causes. However, there are notable violations: (1) Component misclassification for BUG-003 and BUG-019, marking UI instead of backend for performance/loading issues (-13 points); (2) Severity underestimation for BUG-007, BUG-009, BUG-010, and BUG-013, marking medium/high instead of high/critical (-20 points); (3) Duplicate detection gaps, missing BUG-017 as duplicate of BUG-009, BUG-024 as duplicate of BUG-003 and BUG-010 (-12 points). Strengths include: excellent distinction between bugs and feature requests (BUG-008, BUG-020), correct critical severity for payment/data loss issues (BUG-002, BUG-006, BUG-014), proper identification of user error (BUG-022), and comprehensive missing_information lists. The reasoning quality is strong with clear severity rationales focusing on business impact. Team assignments are logical and appropriate. Overall score of 89/100 reflects high-quality triage with room for improvement in component classification for performance issues and severity assessment for complete service breakdowns.",
