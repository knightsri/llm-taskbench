description: "Test task for lecture concept extraction"
input_type: "transcript"
output_format: "csv"

evaluation_criteria:
  - "Concept count (target: 20-24 for 3-hour lecture)"
  - "Timestamp accuracy (within ±5 seconds)"
  - "Duration compliance (2-7 minutes per segment)"
  - "Concept names are descriptive and clear"
  - "No overlapping time ranges"

constraints:
  min_duration_minutes: 2
  max_duration_minutes: 7
  required_csv_columns: ["concept", "start_time", "end_time"]
  timestamp_format: "HH:MM:SS"

examples:
  - input: "Sample transcript snippet about Python programming..."
    expected_output: "01_Introduction_to_Python,00:00:00,00:05:30"
    quality_score: 95
    notes: "Good example with clear concept and proper duration"

judge_instructions: |
  Evaluate the model's output based on:
  1. Accuracy: Are concepts correctly identified?
  2. Format: Is the CSV properly formatted?
  3. Compliance: Do segments meet duration constraints?
