description: "Extract teaching concepts from lecture transcripts with precise timestamps"

input_type: "transcript"
output_format: "csv"

evaluation_criteria:
  - "Concept count (target: 20-24 for 3-hour lecture)"
  - "Timestamp accuracy (within ±5 seconds)"
  - "Duration compliance (2-7 minutes per segment)"
  - "Concept names are descriptive and clear"
  - "No overlapping time ranges"

constraints:
  min_duration_minutes: 2
  max_duration_minutes: 7
  target_duration_minutes: "3-6"
  required_csv_columns: ["concept", "start_time", "end_time"]
  timestamp_format: "HH:MM:SS"

examples:
  - input: "Sample transcript snippet..."
    expected_output: "01_Teaching_Concept,00:20:06,00:23:15"
    quality_score: 95
    notes: "Perfect: 3.15 minute segment, descriptive name, clean timestamps"

judge_instructions: |
  Evaluate the model's output against these specific criteria:

  1. ACCURACY (40 points):
     - Did it identify all major teaching concepts?
     - Are concepts semantically distinct?
     - Are timestamps accurate?

  2. FORMAT (30 points):
     - Valid CSV with required columns?
     - Timestamps in HH:MM:SS format?
     - Concept names follow naming convention?

  3. COMPLIANCE (30 points):
     - All segments 2-7 minutes? (violations: -5 points each)
     - No overlapping timestamps?
     - Concepts in chronological order?
