[00:00] Lisa: Alright everyone, let's get started. Quick standup. Sarah, you want to kick us off?

[00:08] Sarah: Sure. Yesterday I finished the code review for the authentication refactor. Today I'm going to start on the database migration script for the user table changes. No blockers.

[00:22] Lisa: Great. Mike?

[00:25] Mike: So I'm still working on the payment integration. Hit a snag with the Stripe webhook validation - their docs are unclear on the signature verification for test mode. I should have it figured out by end of day. Oh, and I need someone to review my PR for the cart service - it's been sitting there since Friday.

[00:48] Sarah: I can review that this morning, Mike. Send me a ping when you're ready.

[00:52] Mike: Perfect, thanks Sarah.

[00:55] Lisa: Priya?

[00:57] Priya: I wrapped up the new dashboard components yesterday. Today I'm integrating them with the API endpoints Mike finished last week. I'm blocked on the design specs for the mobile responsive version though - we never got final sign-off from design.

[01:15] Lisa: I'll follow up with the design team today. Can you work around it for now and use the desktop version as a starting point?

[01:22] Priya: Yeah, I can make progress on the desktop integration first. But I'll need those specs by Wednesday at the latest to hit our Friday deadline.

[01:30] Lisa: Noted. I'll make sure you have them by tomorrow end of day. Tom?

[01:35] Tom: Yesterday I finished writing test cases for the checkout flow. Found two bugs actually - I've already logged them. One's a minor UI thing, the other is a potential security issue with session handling. Sarah, that second one might need your eyes on it urgently.

[01:52] Sarah: Can you send me the ticket number? I'll look at it right after standup.

[01:56] Tom: Will do. Today I'm starting on regression tests for the payment module. I'll need access to the Stripe test environment - Mike, can you add me?

[02:05] Mike: Oh yeah, I keep forgetting. I'll send you the invite right after this call.

[02:10] Lisa: Anything else before we wrap?

[02:12] Sarah: Quick thing - we should probably schedule a sync with DevOps about the deployment pipeline. The current setup won't handle the new microservices architecture. Can someone reach out to James?

[02:25] Lisa: I'll set that up. Let's aim for Thursday afternoon. I'll send a calendar invite.

[02:30] Lisa: Alright, good standup everyone. Let's crush it today.
