name: "Concepts-Extraction-from-Lecture-Transcript"
goal: |
  Extract concepts covered during the lecture that can be in bite-size chunks
  between 4 and 8 min long to make them useful for students. Essentially not
  too small, and not too long. Easy to search, get to the point and grab the
  necessary knowledge. Some concepts may be shorter and some may be longer,
  but only if that would make sense from the concept covered.

llm_notes: |
  Low-cost and high-quality are the metrics we seek.
  Ensure mid-session breaks are honored, if any.
  Ensure no-gaps in analyzing the full transcript.
  Compare the results - not just number of concepts, but also the quality
  of the concepts captured.

      type: "string"
      description: "Concise, descriptive concept title (2-6 words)"
    - name: "description"

    - name: "end_time"
      type: "timestamp"
      description: "End time in HH:MM:SS format"
  example: |
    {"title": "Introduction to Machine Learning", "description": "Overview of ML concepts, types of learning (supervised, unsupervised), and real-world applications.", "start_time": "00:22:14", "end_time": "00:28:30"}
  notes: "All timestamps must be within the input transcript range. No overlapping segments."

notes: |
  - No gaps from the provided start/end timestamps.
  - Honor any mid-session breaks; do not place segments across a break.
  - Prefer concise, descriptive concept titles and 2-3 sentence summaries.
  - Depth matters: avoid surface-level headings.
  - Output format: JSON array of {title, description, start_time, end_time} with HH:MM:SS timestamps.
